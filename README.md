## Investigating hallucinations in LLMs: A comparative analysis of Retrieval Augmented Generation enhancement approaches
### Author
Lorena Raichle

This repository contains the code, data, and documentation related to the practical part of my bachelor thesis on investigating hallucinations in Large Language Models. The thesis provides a comparative analysis of various RAG enhancement approaches.

For the implementation, the computational resources provided by the state of Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg through bwHPC and the German Research Foundation (DFG) through grant INST 35/1597-1 FUGG have been used.
